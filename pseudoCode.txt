Trie Node:
	Attributes:
		1- endOfString (boolean)
		2- keys (TrieNode[])
	
	Constructors:
		TrieNode() {
			sets endOfString to false.
			sets keys to TrieNode[26] (number of alphabets).
		}
	
	Methods:
		1- isEndOfString() {
				getter for endOfString.
			}
		2- setEndOfString(boolean endOfString) {
				setter for endOfString.
			}

Trie:
	Attributes:
		1- root (TrieNode)
		2- size (int)
	
	Constructors:
		Trie() {
			sets root to new TrieNode
			sets size to 0
		}
		
	Methods:
		1- isMatch(String s, TrieNode node, int index, bolean isFullMatch) {
				parameters:
					s:  the string to check for
					node: the current node (letter)
					index: where to start from the array
					isFullMatch: indicates if we want a whole word match or prefix
				
				algorithm:
					1- if the node is null it will return false.
					2- if the index is the length of the given string,
					3- it will return true if either is true:
						- NOT a full match.
						- node is end of string.
					4- else:
						it will return a recursive call for the same string
						but the node will be the next letter of the string
						and the index will increment
						and the same given isFullMatch in the parameters
		}
		
		2- contains(String s) {
				return isMatch(s, root, 0, true)
					root is where we start
					0 is the first letter of the trie.
					true for full word check.
		}
		
		3- isPrefix(String s) {
			the same as the contains method but isFullMatch is false
			
		}
		
		4- insert(String s) {
			creates a new node and assigns it to root.
			for each letter of the string:
		 		if the position of the letter is null in the array,
				it will create a new node for it and increase its size.
			
			Assigns node to the correct letter possition in the array.
			Sets EndOfString true.
		}
		
		5- delete(String s) {
			calls the delete helper method.
		}
		
		*recursive boolean helper method for deletion*
		6- delete(TrieNode current, String word, int index) {
			parameters:
				currentNode: the current node the method is working with
				word: the wanted string to delete
				index: the current index of the array.
			Algorithm:
				if the index is the last letter of the string:
					if the current letter is not the last letter of the string
						 return false.
					else:
					endOfString will be set to false for the current node
					return isEmpty()
				else:
				node will be assigned the posission of the current letter.
				if the node is empty the method will return false.
				else, it create a new boolean variable called deleteNode.
				deleteNode will be initialized to:
					delete(node, word, index + 1) && !endOfString()
				so if either: delete() == false or endOfString() == false
					deleteNode will be false.
				if deleteNode is true it will assign the node of the letter to null.
				then returns isEmpty()
				else:
					return false.
		}
		
		7- isEmpty() {
			loops through each index of the array
			if all nodes are null, it will return true
		}
		
		8- clear(){
			sets all nodes to null and resets size to 0
		}
		
		9- allWordsPrefix(String p){
			create a new node and assign it to root.
			it will create 2 stacks and an ArrayList to store the result in.
			assign the node to the possision of the last letter of the string.
			push the node (last letter) in stack1
			push the string in stack2
		
			while both stacks are not empty:
				node is assigned to the popped element of stack1.
				the string is assigned to the popped element of stack2.
				if the node is the end of the string the string will be added to the list.
				initialize a counter.
				for each node:
					if the current key node is not null, stack1 will push the key node
					and stack 2 will push the string + 'A's ASCII value + the counter).
					encrement the counter.
					convert the Array List to an array.
			}
		
		10- size(){
			return size
		}

Trie Driver:

ArrayList<String> getPermutations (String s){
	create a new ArrayList type string.
	Base case: if s.length == 0, return the ArrayList.
	Recursive case:
		assign firstCh to the first character of the string.
		assign subStr to the rest of the string.
		create a new ArrayList which is equal to a recursive call of this method for subStr.
		/* 
		*  newList = getPermutations(subStr)
		*		subStr.firstCh saved for later use
		*	newList = getPermutations(subStr.subStr)
		*			subStr.subStr.firstCh saved for later use
		*	 newList = getPermutations(subStr.subStr...subStr)
		*				subStr.subStr...firstCh saved for later use
		*/
	After recurstion:
		for each word in the second list:
			for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++)
				add to the first list:
					(word.substring(0, i) + firstCh + last character)

	return the ArrayList
}

this will give us the permutations only (different arrangements of the letters in a word)
however, for the combinations (permutaions for all letters in that word (can be shorter)),
we will take all of the substrings of the permutations.

Combinations is used for operation #2.
